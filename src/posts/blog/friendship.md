desc: "Friendship is one of the most beautiful relationships people can have; an emotional connect forged with trust in exchange for vulnerability. But sometimes the bond that you thought you had with someone, might not have ever been mutual. Contemplate while you read the poet’s words, as he ponders about something that means different things to different people, but commonly known by a single word - friendship."

We met as strangers, 
And you became a friend.


Your words begin to mean something. 
We stood together through the laughter. 
I thought our friendship was perfect for anything, Unknown of what came after. 


I looked for you in time of difficulty, 
Because I was scared of being alone. 
Helpless in those times of difficulty, 
I felt so betrayed and alone. 


Trust is the basis of friendship, 
I thought you were trustworthy, 
Revealing all my deepest secrets, 
I missed seeing you and feeling I wasn’t that worthy, 
Until you went behind my back and lied,


Later I thought, 
We are all human, we all make mistakes, 
Looked forward for another chance, 
Then I realized the painful truth, that I made a mistake. 


By not seeing in you that I was still a mere stranger to you.
