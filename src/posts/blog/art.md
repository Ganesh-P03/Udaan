Every artist starts off as a learner. The renowned artist Raja Ravi Verma was trained by professional artists in his childhood, The Nightingale Lata Mangeshkar grew up under the influence of the big stage. Even Rabindranath Tagore was introduced to the world of theater, music, and literature at an early age.

These legends continue to inspire us, and it isn't just because they were the creators of fine art. They have consumed common knowledge, learned the ways of the art, and have managed to create something beautiful that no one has ever made before! These artists are the proof of how art is perceived differently by different people, and none of these perspectives are inferior to any other. It is this potential in art that attracts every human being towards it; the power to row their own boat in the vast sea of creativity.


# **What if......**
<br/>

**Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches**, many a time have we heard this quote, but what if you could become the wearer once for a short while? Sounds interesting? The very phrase ‘what if’ opens the doors of imagination. It’s not just because we want to imagine, it’s the in-built code in all of us to thrive for things, positions etc, that is to live like what we can’t in this geometrical world. All this is just a panoramic view of the art of acting. Some of us do this daily with unnoticeable liquidity while for others, it’s not a piece of cake. Little do we realize that we have survived this far because we act! Not just once in a lifetime, but through every second of it.

So, how do we come across this art and express things? The very answer lies in the phrase **‘what if’**. What if you are the person you imagine? That feeling of empowerment and the very essence of it has to be absorbed and then reflected with confidence behaving like “Yes! You are the one”. This is one of the ways how people act out in theaters or in the industry, but like every art, acting too has details to be focussed on. There are various methods which people employ to master the art like Stanislavski method, classical method, method acting, Uta Hagen method etc. The crux of all this is the feel of being the ‘what if’ you have thought of and letting that feel dominate you, making you touch the character’s uniqueness and all his emotions as a whole.

The other setbacks people face while looking up to acting are the fear of the stage and the question, **“Am I good at it?”**. But have you noticed that every day you wake up, you admire yourself in the mirror? There is a personality more unique than anyone out there. There is a voice in your head that guides you, whom you talk to in the silence of night. That is you and that is beautiful. All you have to do is trust yourself and believe in your instincts. I still remember the first time I was given the opportunity to act, and it was a total blackout. All I could see was darkness and hear nothing. I did the act, but it was too superficial; that was my first, and it had to be like that because we are human after all. That day, I realized that the character I took to the stage, his story, his pain, his madness, his happiness are all that matters because he is me, and it’s my duty to bring him out into the light. And then my priority was sorted, fear and criticism being the least ones.

Without acting, this world would have been mundane. All of us like to grab some popcorn, a cozy corner and the remote to the world of movies. Perfect plan for Saturday night, isn’t it? Be it the art in theaters or in the industries, it’s always thrilling to watch performances. As an actor, there is always something to cling on and make a day far from normal. Now that you know the art and the artists, there’s always room for you to sneak out into one of your favorite **‘what if’s**, and call out for a chilling wonderland you may have always dreamt of. That is the power of this art. Happy Acting!

    From a wide range of hobbies that one has the option to pursue, I find art to be one of the most interesting ones. You can never detail a description for art as it is unique in every individual's perspective. This individuality is what brings out so many forms of art, beautiful in their own way. As for me, I have always perceived art as a way to bring out the picture that I imagine on paper. I initially tried to limit my circle to just sketching or doodling as I was never confident enough to try out anything more. Over the course of pandemic, out of boredom, I started with painting and shading and tried to give my pictures a complete look with calligraphy. Since then, I've drawn a few characters from Anime/TV shows and tried some digital art. I usually read a lot, so I also draw book characters and picturesque scenes. Otherwise, I follow a particular theme or aesthetic and try to convey my take on the picture. This has surprisingly helped my confidence and also motivated me to come out of my comfort zone. Although I'm definitely not a pro at art, I've learned to love what I do and that helps me get better at it.

The move online was not all roses though. Clubs and coordinators had to adapt to problems like lack of equipment and different constraints of virtual setting, and they did so commendably. The Debate club shifted operations to discord, using voice channels to conduct group discussions and debates. A virtual environment did not stop members of Actomania from recording a short film on the life of a JEE aspirant, while Sargam members have managed to record some beautiful covers during this time. Some like the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/qciittp/">**Quiz club**</a> managed to look at the positives; not only did they conduct regular sessions on Zoom, but also used this time to coordinate with quiz clubs of other IIT’s to have online Inter-IIT quiz sessions during this period. The Quiz club also partnered with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ecell_iittp/">**E-cell IIT-T**</a> to conduct a Biz-Edutainment quiz, while Literary council conducted Eclectica, an inter-college essay competition. The pandemic bought its problems, but did lead to more collective efforts amongst clubs and institutes.

That’s not all folks! The students of technical affairs committee took this time to build a website to highlight technical clubs, events and projects done by students. The Code club saw a resurgence, conducting regular coding contests. They also shifted operations to Discord, where their server has become a highly active hub for discussions on all things related, from competitive programming to web development. Other students were quick to recognize avenues to contribute to the fight against Covid-19 and worked along with professors on those. <a target="_blank" href="https://survivecovid-19.itch.io/game2020">**SurviveCovid-19**</a>, a game to improve awareness of Covid-19 safety practices, <a target="_blank" href="https://moodofindia.herokuapp.com/">**Mood of India**</a>, a web portal to gauge emotional state of people in an area and COVID Chest X-Ray image classification based on attention based deep learning are some projects worked on by our students and faculty. The sharpness to recognize the need for such solutions and willingness to act on and build such innovations with real life usage have gained our students and professors clout, with their efforts being appreciated by national media.

The pandemic also highlighted the advantage of a fit and healthy body, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/iittirupatisports/">**sports affairs council**</a> was quick to act on it, conducting regular fitness challenges with students required to submit videos of them doing the exercises. It was some well needed motivation for students to finally get off that bed, and has been a success.

The past semester was tough, but if there’s one thing that we know now, it is that whatever the circumstances, the student community of our college will always make the best of it. All the above efforts are commendable, and need to be appreciated.

But that's not all folks, with the next semester comes new undertakings, the most ambitious of all might just be an online edition of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tirutsava.iittirupati/">**Tirutsava**</a>! How that turns out is a story for another day, but if past semester is any indication, there is cause to be optimistic!
