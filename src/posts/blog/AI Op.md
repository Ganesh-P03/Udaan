## The science of today is the technology of tomorrow

```
“ Machine learning is a core, transformative way by which we're re-thinking how we're doing everything ”

- Sundar Pichai

```


We have made tremendous progress in evolving from  primitive beings in small, dreary caves to modern humans in large, bustling cities. But we lack the ability to not think of anything, even for a second. Boredom  is not an option for us. 

**Artificial Intelligence has always caught the  imagination of those who take it upon themselves  to “predict” the outline of future societies.** 

The pace of innovation in AI is breath-taking today.  Artificial Intelligence in simple terms means that machines  and computers are learning, thinking, and doing what  human intelligence does. Over the past few decades, it has  been integrating itself into all aspects of human life, and  now, it is integral to our daily lifestyles. 

**If you have reservations about the use of AI, it may  be comforting to know that most of us have been  using AI daily for many years.** When apps like Google  Maps calculate traffic to find the quickest route to your  destination, that’s AI at work. AI assists in every area of our  lives, whether we’re trying to read our emails, navigation,  music recommendations, searching the web, or even  shopping online! 

Self-driving cars use AI to develop “the power to see, think,  and learn so that they can navigate a nearly infinite range of  possible driving scenarios.” Gmail uses AI to offer users a way to reply to emails with precise phrases like “Thanks!” or  “Let’s do it!” with a click of a button, isn’t it amazing? 

AI powers many programs and services that help us do  everyday things such as connecting with friends, unlocking  phones via face ID, or using a ride-share service. In fact, a  Boeing 777 pilot spends approximately seven minutes  manually piloting the plane. He places the plane on  “autopilot mode” to cover most of the distance. 
AI is used even in forensic investigations! “DNA  sequencing” makes use of AI to sequence strands of DNA  from scattered bone fragments to establish the identity of  victims. 

AI-powered robots are used in the cleaning of nuclear sites,  fire-fighting, welding robots, etc which reduces the perilous  nature of these jobs. ‘‘AI-enhanced education’’ assists  human teachers to make high-quality education precise,  economical, and more widely available. Likewise, AI for  autonomous weapons safeguards humanity too. 
To sum up, Artificial Intelligence is playing a leading role in  today’s societies. Our life is changed by AI because this  technology is very useful in day to day services. Hence it is  clear that AI is all set to be the future of the entire world.  The world seems exciting and intriguing with AI!
