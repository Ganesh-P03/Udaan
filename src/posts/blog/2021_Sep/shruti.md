I am Shruti Priya, a 4th year CSE undergraduate at IIT Tirupati. In this blog, I would like to share my 2 month internship experience at Salesforce. In my third year of college, I got to know about Salesforce through an on-campus recruitment program. After passing through a coding round, two technical interview rounds, and a final HR round, I got a phone call from my recruiter letting me know that I got the job! I was incredibly excited and started preparing myself for the internship.

On May 24th, my two-month internship journey at Salesforce started. The first two weeks were mostly filled with welcoming sessions and training programs to prepare for the upcoming projects. As an intern, I was a part of the Business Technology Public Cloud Engineering Team and worked on projects related to Amazon Web Services Infrastructure Development. To get started with my project I was assigned a mentor who helped me with the project and also aided me in getting familiar with the working culture at Salesforce. From the third week, I started working on projects and my mentor and team helped me whenever I faced any trouble. As a result, in less than 2 months I was able to be a part of three projects. We had daily standup meetings and weekly brainstorming sessions that helped me share my ideas with others and learn about the projects the other team members are working on. Overall it was a great opportunity to work and learn from experienced professionals. 

At Salesforce the word that stood out the most is “Ohana”, a Hawaiian word that means family which is a big part of Salesforce work culture. As it was a virtual internship, I was initially worried if interaction with other fellow interns and seniors would be a problem. However, Salesforce hosted weekly intern meets, where we got a chance to interact with each other and play a few games. To get acquainted with our leaders, Salesforce hosted leadership connections once or twice a week, where we directly had one-to-one conversations with the Business Technology team leaders. To encourage us in giving our 100% at work along with a healthy body and a healthy mind, Salesforce hosted regular wellness and mental awareness sessions. We also had the opportunity to join different groups and spread mental awareness across the globe. In the two months, I was able to attend 2 wellness sessions in which we were introduced to different breathing and meditation techniques to relax our minds to help focus on our work.


In conclusion, it was an amazing experience being an intern at Salesforce and I am thankful to my team and fellow interns for making my internship journey fruitful and fun at the same time. I also was offered a Pre Placement Opportunity to work at Salesforce and I am really excited to join Salesforce as a full-time employee in the upcoming year.
