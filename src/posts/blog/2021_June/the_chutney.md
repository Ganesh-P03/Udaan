The standard ‘Mom’ alarm rings: “Beta, wake up, go buy two packets of milk and one coconut. Hurry up! The shops will close soon.” This has been my ever-reliable alarm during the lockdown. Online classes, assignment deadlines or whatever may it be, it rings every alternate day sharp at 7’o clock. On the days I am deep in my slumber, it’s my Dad who is the victim of this.

I get up, fold my blankets, brush my teeth. And soon enough I wear my regular track pants and my mask, and get ready: “Mission status - Walk a kilometer, bring all the things on the list.” Why the jogging pants you ask? Just to satisfy my failed dreams of regular exercise. Whether I exercise or not, seeing the track pants reminds my lazy self that I indeed stepped out today.

I take a few steps out of my home, and I am greeted by the rays of sunshine on my face. It’s a surreal feeling, akin to a caveman stepping out of his world for the first time. Never in my right mind did I imagine that we would live in a world where stepping out of our homes would be such a glorious event. Ahem, all the glory stops right there. Hardly a hundred meters on, I am jolted by the sirens of an ambulance. And I am well and truly awake.

I check the list once again. It’s the regular old coconut staring at my face. Whatever may be the circumstance, the coconut is ever-present in the list, just like the Virat Kohli on the team sheet. The coconut adds that extra zing to any dish that you do make. In specific - the chutney. For those of you who ever googled what chutney is: “Chutneys may be realized in such forms as a tomato relish, a ground peanut garnish, yogurt or curd, cucumber, spicy coconut, spicy onion or mint dipping sauce”. No shit, Sherlock. It’s not that complicated. Just put some regular spices and grind them. And choose the right coconut. It should be the correct shade of brown, which makes it all the more delicious.

The really good part about chutney is that it basically goes with anything. Idlis, dosas or chapatis, rice, you name it. And it’s inexpensive to make. Every person knows his/her own variant of the chutney, which makes it a unique dish. Especially during a pandemic, when everything seems uncertain, one thing that can help you out on any day is the chutney.

As I walked right down the middle of empty main roads, my mind was racing with a lot of thoughts. For all the technological progress, life circumstances, or time of day, chutney remains ever-present in our culture. For those of you who are bored, just connect your lives with chutney. I read a lot of emails or articles stating how being at the best of your productive self helps your mind, progress, and yada yada. For all the hoopla on productivity, the chutney stares at your face and screams: “Why so complicated?”

The recipe for a chutney remains the same, but with our own twists and variants. A gentle reminder of our own lives in a sense. I always had these words drilled into my head: “Be your better self, work hard and improve yourself.” During a pandemic, these words ring hollow. This is why I love the chutney. It doesn’t do anything different, it’s almost the same, but still is important. The same inexpensive dish brings satisfaction and smiles to millions of people. It shows you that even if you don’t do anything spectacular, your days can bring you a sense of satisfaction. Yes, there are deadlines, assignments, grades, and so on. But, none of these things are supposed to be important in the long run. You do your part and leave the rest. Just like the chutney.

As I enter my home and wash my hands with soap, I hear an apologetic voice: “Beta, I forgot. We needed coriander too.” Me, slightly annoyed that I will probably have to wash my hands again, decide to go out again. Coriander. Hmm. Well, Coriander and Khichdi can be our next topic, why not?
