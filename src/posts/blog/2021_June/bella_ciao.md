The first year usually flows in struggling to come to terms with this flurry of events. From another perspective, a metamorphosis from a studious JEE aspirant to an easy-going undergrad student. One of the most enjoyable aspects of engineering life is the casual chaos that we immerse ourselves into.

Waking up and making a run for the first class of the day, the moral dilemma that we encounter while on the journey from the mess to the classroom complex, tempted to take the enticing detour to our hostel rooms and give the sleepy afternoon classes a heave-ho. As we stroll leisurely, embroiled in this mental tug of war, the sudden sirens of WhatsApp notifications warn us of an impending surprise test.  We set off on a mid-day sprint to make it on time.

After a day of ups and downs at 11:59 pm, we&rsquo;re hit with an adrenaline rush of an F1 driver, scurrying to finish and submit our assignments moments before the deadline. All these experiences, though seeming mundane, transform into memories because of the people around us.  During these 4 years, we bear witness to numerous changes, introverts becoming the most talkative ones, friends becoming family. Contrary to popular belief, the most cherished memories lie in the simplest of things, the two-minute conversations that snowball into night-long chats, the leisurely strolls around campus, and the inside jokes cracked during classes.

As the unsettling realisation dawns upon us, that this four year journey has come to an end, the memories come flooding back, all at once. Though this parting is difficult, painful, the lessons and friendships this journey showered us with will last for a lifetime.

We never really leave the campus, the true spirit of engineering life will continue to live on. Every batch, though longer present physically, will continue to thrive, as peels of laughter and the buzz of conversation in the mess, as shouts of glee echoing through the hostel corridors, as the common sigh of relief after the last exam, as the spirit of friendship that binds us together, everyone of us will continue to live on in the place we once called home.
