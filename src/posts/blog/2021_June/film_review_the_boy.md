The college had just announced the postponement of classes for an entire month, and my excitement knew no bounds. I had several plans in the back of my mind to execute during these &ldquo;vacations&rdquo;. But before that, I needed a break! And what could be more suitable than watching some movies?

So I just surfed through the internet, searched for some excellent Hollywood movies to watch (as I am a complete novice in this matter) when I found out &ldquo;THE BOY&rdquo;. It is a horror movie, and hence, it intrigued me.

Having watched its thrilling trailer on YouTube, I was somewhat determined to watch it.

William Brent Bell, the movie director, has done an excellent job in making this film. The screenplay and screening of this horror movie wonâ€™t let your goosebumps settle down.

The movie&rsquo;s setting is similar to what one would expect from a film of this genre. A huge and lonely mansion with only one resident, who is left alone with a creepy doll, seems to be the theme for the movie.

The story starts when Greta Evans (role played by Lauren Cohan) visits the Heelshires&rsquo; House to babysit their eight-year-old boy child Brahms when his parents are to go for a vacation. The parents introduce him as a notorious child and say that he loves to play pranks. We are then shown a boy doll as their child, and its face scares the hell out of us. As expected, the lady considers all of this a stupid nonsensical, taboo thing and does not take care of the doll (Brahms) the way as specified by the Heelshires. Therefore, many paranormal activities start to happen, which may prompt you to shut your T.V. and leave. But trust me, the movie is worth giving a watch.

Rupert Evans also leaves a remarkable impression in his role as the grocery boy Malcolm who acquaints Greta with the history of the sad demise of Brahms 20 years ago in a fire.

&ldquo;The Boy&rdquo; also depicts a short love story between Greta and Malcolm. Hence, it is a complete mixture of drama, suspense, thrill, horror, romance and tragedy. However, one may not expect much music from it.

The movie&rsquo;s plot is well-defined as a whole. However, it seems ways too abstract through the end. The best part of the movie is that the plot takes a sharp turn at the climax, which changes the complete understanding of the movie. Don&rsquo;t worry; I am not going to spoil your fun.

In short, the movie writer Stacey Menear has done an excellent job. You can undoubtedly watch this movie with your friends at night (or alone if you are not weak-hearted).

If I were a movie critic (which I am not), I would give this movie three and a half stars (and I have cut the stars because I couldn&rsquo;t sleep until late-night after watching this).
